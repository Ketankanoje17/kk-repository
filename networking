Networking:
provide: communication,sharing software, sharing file ,sharing info, information preservation,security,sharing hardware,sharing data

LAN- Local Area Network
  - 5 to 10 sysytem join and communicate only this 10 system cannot communicate extra system callled LAN. --LAN cable(Small range) ex:our wifi,mobile hotspot

MAN-Metropolitian Area Network- we provide the network big area this network used big area called MAN ex:university,comapny organisation,hospital (Internet Service Provider)

WAN-Wide Area Network -  we communicate worldwide called wide area network : ex : communicate A to b (www)

public  -  WAN -wide area network communicate that time used WAN 
private - small range communication that time used private LAN
static  -  static once used then this address register particular user
dynamic - at a runtime allocated ip called dynamic


MAC address -:Media Access Control Address -device identifier and network Interface controller using mac
48 bits = 6 bytes
0A:22:84:D5:65:V4
organisation unique identifier:Network Interface Controller 


what is port:
 communication between one system to another system via IP address


cmd - getmac
   check details - mac lookeup


One system communicate another system via IP address - source - destination is IP.

ports - port provide speicifif IP address way to send and received using this port address.
at a time only one port used cannot used same time same port  1 - 65535
 -Path, Communication, Only an open port ,1-65535, one port at a time

protocol - set of rule, How data is transmiited, Device Communication
  - TCP                                                UDP
  
  tcp/ip layer
  Application - >  Telnet ,smtp, pop3, FTP, NTP,HTTP,SNMP,DNS,SSH
  Transport - TCP, UDP - core commuincation managment - any sysem communicate using this protocolIntermet -  IR ,ICMP,ARP,DHCP
  internet
  Network Access - Ethernet,PPP,ADSL
  
  
  URG - data container in the packet should should be processed immediately
  FIN -  there will be no further transmission
  RST - reset a connection
  PSH - send all buffered data immediately
  ACK- acknowledged the reciept of a packet
  SYN - initiate a connection between hosts
  
  
   TCP Three way handshake4
   TCP session Termination

DNS - Domain Name System
   every website own private IP address  but every time not mind this ,so thats why we name provide this particular IP address then search on search Engine
